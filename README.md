This is a compilation of SQL queries I have written.

- dvd_rental: pulls data using PreSQL in order to answer questions about what movies are being rented and how different stores are performing.

- world_temperature: pulls data using PreSQL in order to assess how the change in temperature in London compares to the rest of the world.
