# World Temperature Project
@gabrielsgaspar


This project uses PreSQL in order to pull data for world temperature by cities in order to answer the following questions:

- How does the change in temperature in London compare to the change in temperature worldwide?

- Is London following the same trend of increase in average temperature as the rest of the world?

- Are the average temperature of London and the world converging?

- How the the temperatures of London and the rest of the world compare in 1800 and 2010?
